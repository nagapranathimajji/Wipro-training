The old, abandoned lighthouse stood tall against the churning sea, its weathered stone 
walls a testament to countless storms it had endured. Inside, the air was thick with the
scent of salt and decay, the silence broken only by the rhythmic crashing of waves against 
the rocks below. Once a beacon of hope for sailors navigating treacherous waters, it now 
stood as a silent sentinel, its light long extinguished. Yet, within its lonely chambers,
 whispers of past lives and maritime tales seemed to linger, carried on the salty breeze. 
 The sea birds cried out as they circled its desolate perch, adding a touch of melancholic 
 beauty to the scene.
